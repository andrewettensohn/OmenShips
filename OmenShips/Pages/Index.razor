<MudText Class="mb-3">The inital purpose of this app is to test space ship combat. You can build a ship by going to the fitted ships page. I can't be bothered to add modify and delete buttons just yet. The data in this app will be cleaned every playtest and we will only keep the modules that are fun and balanced.</MudText>

<MudText Class="mb-3">Ships are made of three things:</MudText>
<MudText><MudIcon Icon="@Icons.Material.Outlined.AddCircle" /> Class: This relates to this size of the ship. A larger ship moves slower and is less stealthly but has more slots for modules.</MudText>
<MudText><MudIcon Icon="@Icons.Material.Outlined.AddCircle" /> Hull: The skeleton of the ship. The hull determines the number of hitpoints a ship has and any special abilities.</MudText>
<MudText Class="mb-8"><MudIcon Icon="@Icons.Material.Outlined.AddCircle" /> Modules: A module could be a gun, armor, shields, reactor, engine..etc.</MudText>

<MudText Class="mb-3">Modules are broken down into the following categories:</MudText>
<MudText><MudIcon Icon="@Icons.Material.Outlined.WifiTethering" /> Sensor: These modules are the eyes of the ship. Without a high sensor rating, your ship will be unable to see other ships.</MudText>
<MudText><MudIcon Icon="@Icons.Material.Outlined.BlurOn" /> Stealth/Black Ops: A high stealth score means your ship can remain hidden and thus safe from attack.</MudText>
<MudText><MudIcon Icon="@Icons.Material.Outlined.DoubleArrow" /> Speed: The maximum amount of hex spaces your ship can move on the table top per turn.</MudText>
<MudText><MudIcon Icon="@Icons.Material.Outlined.Adjust" /> Shield: These modules negate damage done by plasma weapons.</MudText>
<MudText><MudIcon Icon="@Icons.Material.Outlined.AddModerator" /> Armor: These modules negate damage done by railgun weapons.</MudText>

<MudText><MudIcon Icon="@Icons.Material.Outlined.WbSunny" /> Plasma: These weapons are good against armor and bad against shields, they typically have short ranges and deal high damage.</MudText>
<MudText><MudIcon Icon="@Icons.Material.Outlined.Bolt" /> Rail: These weapons are good against shields and bad against armor, they typically have long ranges and deal low damage.</MudText>
<MudText><MudIcon Icon="@Icons.Material.Outlined.DirectionsRailway" /> Missile: These weapons cannot be negated by armor or shields. Whenever a missile weapon is fired, a token is added to the table top that has its own speed and can be shot down by projectile weapons.</MudText>
<MudText Class="mb-8"><MudIcon Icon="@Icons.Material.Outlined.Api" /> Projectile: These are the only weapons that can target missiles. They deal low damage and are short range and their damage is negated by armor.</MudText>

<MudText Class="mb-3">These module categories are planned to be added later:</MudText>
<MudText><MudIcon Icon="@Icons.Material.Outlined.Memory" /> Electronic Warfare (EWAR): Modules that assist with hacking enemy ships or protecting against hacks.</MudText>
<MudText><MudIcon Icon="@Icons.Material.Outlined.HouseSiding" /> Hanger: Allows for control of fighter squadrons. Squadrons get their own token on the table-top and have their own stats and modules.</MudText>
<MudText><MudIcon Icon="@Icons.Material.Outlined.BugReport" /> Drone Control: Allows for control of drone squadrons which work similar to fighters.</MudText>
